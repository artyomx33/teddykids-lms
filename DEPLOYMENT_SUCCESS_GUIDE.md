# 🚀 Deployment Success Guide

## What to Test After Deployment

### 1. Widget Test (Priority!)
**URL**: https://app.teddykids.nl/widget/disc-assessment

**Expected**:
- ✅ See the DISC Assessment form (not white screen!)
- ✅ Purple gradient background
- ✅ 40-question assessment
- ✅ Progress bar working

**If you see**:
- ❌ White screen → Check deploy logs
- ❌ 404 error → Route not deployed
- ✅ Assessment form → SUCCESS!

---

### 2. Main Dashboard Test
**URL**: https://app.teddykids.nl/labs/talent

**Test Each Tab**:
1. **Candidates (1)** - Should show your 1 real candidate
2. **Analytics** - Should show real metrics (not 156 applications!)
3. **AI Insights** - Select candidate → see insights
4. **Approval** - Should show real candidate for approval
5. **Overview** - Should show real pipeline stats

**Expected Console Logs** (Development Mode):
```
🚀 [TalentAcquisition] Initializing - Production Mode
🔍 [useCandidates] Fetching real candidates from Supabase...
✅ [useCandidates] Fetched 1 real candidates
📊 [useAnalytics] Analytics calculated
```

---

### 3. Website Embed Test
**Your Website**: Embed the iframe code

**Expected**:
- Widget loads in iframe
- Form is fully functional
- Submission saves to Supabase
- New candidate appears in dashboard immediately (real-time!)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

|------|----------------|

| Dashboard - Candidates | ✅ Shows 1 real candidate |
| Dashboard - Analytics | ✅ Real numbers (not mock 156) |
