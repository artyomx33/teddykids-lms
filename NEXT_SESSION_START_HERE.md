## üéØ Phase 0: Component Hardening (Start Here!)

**Goal**: Prepare codebase for React 19 migration  
**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)  
**Branch**: Create new ‚Üí `refactor/phase-0-component-hardening`

### Why Phase 0 is Critical

Your biggest component, **ReviewForm.tsx** (917 lines!), will be most vulnerable during React 19 migration. Breaking it down FIRST makes migration:
- ‚úÖ 10x easier to debug
- ‚úÖ 5x faster to complete
- ‚úÖ 90% less risky

---

## üìã Phase 0 Day-by-Day Plan

### **Day 1: Analyze & Plan** (2-3 hours)

```bash
# 1. Create new branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b refactor/phase-0-component-hardening

# 2. Analyze ReviewForm.tsx
wc -l src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx
# Expected: 917 lines

# 3. Read the component thoroughly
# Open: src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx
# Document: All props, state, handlers, effects

# 4. Read refactoring guide
# Open: src/agents/component-refactoring-architect.md
# Study: Patterns and anti-patterns

# 5. Create refactoring plan
# List: What to extract (hooks, components, utilities)
```

**Deliverable**: Document what you'll extract and how

---

### **Day 2: Extract Custom Hooks** (4-6 hours)

```bash
# Create hooks directory
mkdir -p src/components/reviews/hooks

# Extract these hooks from ReviewForm.tsx:
# 1. useReviewForm.ts - Form state management
# 2. useReviewTemplates.ts - Template logic
# 3. useReviewSubmission.ts - API calls
# 4. useReviewValidation.ts - Validation logic
# 5. useReviewCalculations.ts - Score calculations

# Test after EACH extraction:
npm run build
npm run dev
# Verify ReviewForm still works!
```

**Deliverable**: 5 custom hooks extracted, all functionality preserved

---

### **Day 3: Split UI Components** (4-6 hours)

```bash
# Create sections directory
mkdir -p src/components/reviews/ReviewForm/sections

# Extract these components:
# 1. ReviewFormHeader.tsx - Title, status, metadata
# 2. BasicInfoSection.tsx - Staff, reviewer, date fields
# 3. TemplateQuestionsSection.tsx - Template questions
# 4. SelfAssessmentSection.tsx - Self assessment
# 5. DISCPersonalitySection.tsx - DISC questions
# 6. GoalsSection.tsx - Goals and development
# 7. ReviewFormActions.tsx - Save, submit, cancel buttons

# Test after EACH component:
npm run build
npm run dev
# Verify all features work!
```

**Deliverable**: 7 UI components extracted, ReviewForm.tsx now ~150 lines

---

### **Day 4: Add Error Boundaries** (3-4 hours)

```bash
# 1. Create error boundary component
# File: src/components/error-boundaries/SectionErrorBoundary.tsx

# 2. Wrap EVERY section in error boundary
<SectionErrorBoundary sectionName="BasicInfo">
  <BasicInfoSection />
</SectionErrorBoundary>

# 3. Add page-level boundary
<ErrorBoundary componentName="ReviewForm">
  <ReviewFormContent />
</ErrorBoundary>

# 4. Test error handling
# Intentionally break something, verify boundary catches it
```

**Deliverable**: Error boundaries on all sections + page level

---

### **Day 5: Testing & Documentation** (3-4 hours)

```bash
# 1. Full app testing
npm run build
npm run dev

# Test EVERYTHING in ReviewForm:
# ‚ñ° Create new review
# ‚ñ° Edit existing review
# ‚ñ° Complete review
# ‚ñ° Template questions work
# ‚ñ° Self assessment works
# ‚ñ° DISC personality works
# ‚ñ° Goals section works
# ‚ñ° Validation works
# ‚ñ° Save draft works
# ‚ñ° Submit works
# ‚ñ° All buttons work

# 2. Document what you did
# Create: PHASE_0_REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md
# List: All extractions, lessons learned

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: complete Phase 0 component hardening

- Extracted 5 custom hooks from ReviewForm
- Split into 7 smaller components
- Added error boundaries everywhere
- ReviewForm.tsx: 917 lines ‚Üí 150 lines
- All functionality preserved and tested
- Preparing for React 19 migration"

# 4. Push
git push origin refactor/phase-0-component-hardening

# 5. Create PR
# Title: "Phase 0: Component Hardening for React 19 Migration"
# Description: Use PHASE_0_REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md
```

**Deliverable**: PR ready for review, all tests passing

## üìö Essential Reading Before Starting

### Must Read (30 minutes)
1. **Component Refactoring Architect**: `src/agents/component-refactoring-architect.md`
   - Read sections: "Core Refactoring Principles", "Refactoring Patterns"
   
2. **ReviewForm Current Code**: `src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx`
   - Understand what you're refactoring

3. **Architecture Review**: `docs/dependency-health/ARCHITECT_REVIEW_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Section: "Risk 1: Large Components Will Break Silently"

### Reference During Work
- `src/agents/component-refactoring-architect.md` - Patterns & anti-patterns
- `docs/dependency-health/MAJOR_VERSION_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` - Overall plan

---

## ‚ö° Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Start Phase 0
git checkout -b refactor/phase-0-component-hardening

# Check component size
wc -l src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx

# Test after changes
npm run build && npm run dev

# Commit progress
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: extract [what you extracted]"

# Final push
git push origin refactor/phase-0-component-hardening
```

---

## üÜò If You Get Stuck

### Problem: Don't know what to extract?
**Solution**: Look for repeated patterns:
- Multiple `useState` calls ‚Üí Extract to custom hook
- 100+ lines of JSX ‚Üí Extract to component
- Complex calculations ‚Üí Extract to utility function

### Problem: Afraid of breaking something?
**Solution**: Extract ONE thing at a time, test after each:
1. Extract hook
2. Test (build + dev)
3. Extract component
4. Test (build + dev)
5. Repeat

### Problem: TypeScript errors?
**Solution**: Don't use `any`! Create proper interfaces:
```typescript
// Bad:
const hook = (data: any) => { }

// Good:
interface ReviewFormData {
  staff_id: string;
  summary: string;
  // ... all fields
}
const hook = (data: ReviewFormData) => { }
```

### Problem: Lost functionality?
**Solution**: Compare with original:
```bash
# View original ReviewForm.tsx
git show main:src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx

# Make sure you preserved EVERYTHING
```

## üéâ After Phase 0 Complete

When Phase 0 is done and PR merged:

### Next: React 19 Migration (Week 1-2)
```bash
# Much easier now that components are small!
git checkout -b migration/react-19

# Run compatibility checks
# See: docs/dependency-health/DEPENDENCY_MONITOR_VERDICT.md
# Section: "Critical Action Items"

# Update React
npm install react@19 react-dom@19 @types/react@19 @types/react-dom@19

# Fix TypeScript errors (much easier with small components!)
npm run build

# Test (much easier with error boundaries!)
npm run dev
```
