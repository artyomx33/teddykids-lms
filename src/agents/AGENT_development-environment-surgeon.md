## üéõÔ∏è Specific Optimizations

### **Vite Configuration Excellence**
```typescript
// Surgical Vite optimization for zero-conflict, maximum performance
export default defineConfig({
  // Chrome extension compatibility
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
    strictPort: true,
    hmr: {
      overlay: false, // No visual noise
      clientPort: 8080
    },
    watch: {
      // Optimize file watching
      ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**']
    }
  },

  // Build optimization
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
    minify: 'esbuild',
    sourcemap: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          ui: ['@radix-ui/react-*']
        }
      }
    }
  },

  // Development performance
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['react', 'react-dom', '@radix-ui/*'],
    exclude: ['@vite/client', '@vite/env']
  }
});
```

### **TypeScript Perfection**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "incremental": true,
    "tsBuildInfoFile": ".tsbuildinfo"
  }
}
```

### **Environment Health Scripts**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Development Environment Health Check
set -e

echo "üè• Development Environment Surgeon - Health Check"
echo "================================================"

# Performance baseline
START_TIME=$(date +%s%N)

# Memory check
MEMORY_USAGE=$(ps -o pid,ppid,%mem,%cpu,cmd -e | grep -E "(node|chrome)" | head -10)
echo "üìä Current Memory Usage:"
echo "$MEMORY_USAGE"

# Port availability
if lsof -Pi :8080 -sTCP:LISTEN -t >/dev/null ; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Port 8080 is already in use"
    lsof -Pi :8080 -sTCP:LISTEN
else
    echo "‚úÖ Port 8080 is available"
fi

# Node modules integrity
if [ -d "node_modules" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Node modules present"
else
    echo "‚ùå Node modules missing - run npm install"
    exit 1
fi

# TypeScript check
echo "üîç TypeScript quick check..."
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck

# End performance measurement
END_TIME=$(date +%s%N)
DURATION=$((($END_TIME - $START_TIME) / 1000000))
echo "‚ö° Health check completed in ${DURATION}ms"
```

## üìä Target Metrics

### **Zero Tolerance Standards**
- ‚úÖ **0 console errors** during normal development
- ‚úÖ **0 TypeScript warnings** in production code
- ‚úÖ **<2 second HMR** reload times
- ‚úÖ **100% console cleanliness** score
- ‚úÖ **<5 second** initial dev server startup

const DevPerformanceMonitor = {
  hmrLatency: [],
  memoryUsage: [],
  consoleErrors: 0,

  measureHMR: (start, end) => {
    const latency = end - start;
    this.hmrLatency.push(latency);
    if (latency > 2000) {
      console.warn(`üö® HMR Slow: ${latency}ms`);
    }
  },

  getHealthScore: () => {
    const avgHMR = this.hmrLatency.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / this.hmrLatency.length;
    const errorPenalty = this.consoleErrors * 10;
    return Math.max(0, 100 - (avgHMR / 20) - errorPenalty);
  }
