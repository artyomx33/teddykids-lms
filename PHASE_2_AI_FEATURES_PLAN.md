# 🧠 Phase 2: AI Features & Behavioral Intelligence

> **Luna-Approved Enhancement Plan**  
> **Target:** Q1 2026  
> **Goal:** Add emotional clustering and AI-powered behavioral insights

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 2 introduces **AI-powered behavioral tagging** based on DISC assessment patterns. This is Luna's "emotional clustering" - using AI to predict workplace behavior patterns and team fit beyond basic DISC colors.

---

## 🔮 RedFlagEngine AI System

### Core Concept
Use AI to analyze DISC question responses and identify **behavioral patterns** that predict:
- Work style compatibility
- Team dynamics fit
- Stress response patterns
- Communication preferences
- Potential friction points

### Behavioral Tags

#### Conflict Management
- **"Needs strong team structure"** - Green/Blue candidates who thrive with clear hierarchy
- **"Conflict-prone"** - High Red + Low Green combinations, especially Q23, Q29 patterns
- **"Peacekeeper"** - High Green candidates who avoid confrontation
- **"Direct communicator"** - Red/Yellow candidates who prefer straightforward feedback

#### Environmental Needs
- **"Best in low-noise groups"** - Blue candidates sensitive to chaos (Q15, Q31 patterns)
- **"Thrives in chaos"** - Yellow/Red candidates who excel in dynamic environments
- **"Routine-oriented"** - Blue/Green candidates who prefer predictable schedules
- **"Flexible adapter"** - Yellow candidates comfortable with change

#### Team Dynamics
- **"Natural mentor"** - Green candidates with teaching indicators (Q8, Q19)
- **"Solo achiever"** - Red/Blue candidates who work best independently
- **"Collaboration champion"** - Yellow/Green social butterflies
- **"Silent supporter"** - Green candidates who support without needing recognition

#### Leadership Style
- **"Emergent leader"** - Red/Yellow candidates with initiative patterns
- **"Behind-the-scenes organizer"** - Blue/Green candidates who lead through systems
- **"Reluctant leader"** - High Green with low Red, good team members but avoid spotlight
- **"Inspiring motivator"** - High Yellow candidates who energize teams

## 🎨 Implementation Design

### 1. AI Analysis Pipeline

```typescript
interface BehavioralAnalysis {
  candidate_id: string;
  disc_profile: DISCProfile;
  
  // AI-generated tags
  conflict_style: 'direct' | 'avoidant' | 'collaborative' | 'competitive';
  work_environment: 'structured' | 'dynamic' | 'flexible' | 'quiet';
  team_role: 'leader' | 'supporter' | 'innovator' | 'organizer' | 'connector';
  communication_preference: 'direct' | 'detailed' | 'warm' | 'informal';
  
  // Behavioral tags
  behavioral_tags: string[];
  
  // Risk indicators
  friction_risks: {
    tag: string;
    confidence: number;
    mitigation_strategy: string;
  }[];
  
  // Optimal conditions
  thrives_when: string[];
  struggles_when: string[];
  
  // AI confidence
  analysis_confidence: number; // 0-100%
  generated_at: string;
}
```

### 2. Question Pattern Detection

```typescript
const CONFLICT_PRONE_PATTERNS = {
  // Red flag combinations
  high_conflict_risk: {
    Q23: ['Option A', 'Option B'],  // "I get angry when..."
    Q29: ['Option C'],               // "I respond to criticism by..."
    Q35: ['Option A'],               // "In disagreements I..."
    disc_pattern: { red: '>=10', green: '<=5' }
  },
  
  team_structure_need: {
    Q12: ['Option B'],  // "I work best when..."
    Q18: ['Option D'],  // "I prefer projects that..."
    disc_pattern: { blue: '>=12', green: '>=10' }
  },
  
  low_noise_preference: {
    Q15: ['Option A'],  // "My ideal work environment..."
    Q31: ['Option C'],  // "I concentrate best when..."
    disc_pattern: { blue: '>=10', yellow: '<=5' }
  }
};
```

### 3. Database Schema Addition

```sql
-- Phase 2 addition to candidates table
ALTER TABLE candidates 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS behavioral_analysis JSONB,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS behavioral_tags TEXT[],
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS conflict_style TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS work_environment_preference TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS team_role TEXT;

-- Index for AI-powered search
CREATE INDEX idx_candidates_behavioral_tags 
  ON candidates USING GIN(behavioral_tags);

CREATE INDEX idx_candidates_conflict_style 
  ON candidates(conflict_style);
```

### 4. UI Components

```typescript
// Behavioral Tag Display
<BehavioralTagsDisplay tags={candidate.behavioral_tags} />

// Shows tags like:
// 🎯 Direct Communicator
// 🌿 Needs Strong Team Structure  
// ⚡ Thrives in Chaos
// 🤝 Natural Mentor

// With hover tooltips explaining what each tag means
```

## 🔮 Future Vision: AI-Powered Team Building

### Ultimate Goal
Input desired team composition, and AI suggests:
1. **Candidate matches** - Who fits this team's dynamic?
2. **Balance analysis** - Does team need more structure or energy?
3. **Friction predictions** - Which combinations might clash?
4. **Growth opportunities** - How can this team develop together?

### Example Query
```
Query: "I need a teacher for my 3+ years group. Current team is:
- Lead: Red/Blue (Strategic Leader)
- Assistant: Green/Green (Peaceful Supporter)
- Intern: Yellow/Yellow (Sunshine Spreader)"

AI Response:
✅ Best fit: Blue/Yellow (Creative Organizer)
   - Balances existing energy
   - Adds planning capacity
   - Complements lead's structure
   - Won't clash with green supporter
   
⚠️ Avoid: Red/Yellow (Chaos Navigator)
   - Too much energy + Red/Blue lead = friction
   - May overwhelm green supporter
   - Better suited for toddler group
```
