# 🔧 Widget White Screen Troubleshooting

## Error: "Cannot access 'le' before initialization"

**Status**: PR merged ✅, but old build cached ❌

---

## 🎯 Quick Fixes (Try in Order)

### 1. Hard Refresh Widget URL
```
Visit: https://app.teddykids.nl/widget/disc-assessment
Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### 3. Force Vercel Redeployment
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments
# 2. Click "..." on latest deployment
# 3. Click "Redeploy"
# 4. Check "Use existing build cache" is UNCHECKED
```

### 4. Verify Build Hash Changed
```
Check deployed files:
Old build: data-vendor-dhNFCzM8.js
New build: Should have different hash

If same hash → deployment didn't pick up changes
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Check 1: Is logger.ts deployed?
```
View source on:
https://app.teddykids.nl/assets/index-[hash].js

Search for: "queryError" 
Should find: function definition
```

### Check 2: Check Vercel logs
```
Vercel Dashboard → Deployment → Function logs
Look for: Build success or any errors
```

### Check 3: Test in Incognito
```
Open: https://app.teddykids.nl/widget/disc-assessment
In: Incognito/Private window (no cache)
```

## 💡 Most Likely Issue

**BROWSER CACHE!**

The old broken build is cached in your browser.

**Solution**: Hard refresh or incognito mode

## ✅ When Fixed

You'll see:
- DISC Assessment form
- Purple gradient background
- No white screen
- No console errors

*The code is correct - just needs cache cleared!*
