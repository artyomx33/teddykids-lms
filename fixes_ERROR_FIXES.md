# 🔧 ERROR FIXES - Staff Profile Page

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 THE BUG

### Error Message:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')
    at fetchStaffDetail (staff.ts:237:67)
```

### Root Cause:
The `buildEmploymentJourney()` function returns `null` when it encounters an error (e.g., staff not found). The code was trying to access `.length` on `null`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 237)
realContracts = await buildEmploymentJourney(staffRecord.employes_id);
console.log('✅ Employment contracts loaded:', realContracts.length); // ❌ CRASH if null
```

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### 1. **Added Optional Chaining** (Line 237)
```typescript
// AFTER
realContracts = await buildEmploymentJourney(staffRecord.employes_id);
console.log('✅ Employment contracts loaded:', realContracts?.length || 0); // ✅ Safe
```

### 2. **Added Null Coalescing** (Line 274)
```typescript
// BEFORE
contracts: realContracts, // ❌ Could be null

// AFTER
contracts: realContracts || [], // ✅ Always an array
```

---

## 🎯 CHANGES MADE

### File: `src/lib/staff.ts`

**Line 237:**
```diff
- console.log('✅ Employment contracts loaded:', realContracts.length);
+ console.log('✅ Employment contracts loaded:', realContracts?.length || 0);
```

**Line 274:**
```diff
- contracts: realContracts, // 🔥 REAL CONTRACTS FROM EMPLOYES.NL!
+ contracts: realContracts || [], // 🔥 REAL CONTRACTS FROM EMPLOYES.NL!
```

---

## ✅ RESULT

- ✅ No more TypeError
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ Graceful handling when employment data is unavailable
