# 🔧 CONTRACTS FEATURE - STATUS UPDATE

## ✅ FIXED JUST NOW

### **1. Enhanced Timeline Cards** 💰
**You said:** "no extra info is shown... i would like to see hours, bruto and neto"

**Fixed!** Timeline cards now show:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Bruto    Neto ~    Hours     │
│ €2,539   €1,777    36h       │
│ per month estimated per week  │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Bruto** (gross monthly salary)
- ✅ **Neto** (estimated net monthly using 2024 Dutch tax rates)
- ✅ **Hours** (per week)
- ✅ Beautiful 3-column grid layout
- ✅ Color-coded (blue=bruto, green=neto, purple=hours)
- ✅ Professional Dutch payroll format

### **2. Contract Events Now Show Full View** 🏢
**You said:** "Contract Renewed shows Event Details instead of full contract"

**Fixed!** Now detects ANY contract-related event:
- Contract Started
- Contract Renewed
- Contract Changed
- Contract Extended
- etc.

**Status:** Will show contract placeholder with note "Full contract rendering coming soon..."

---

## 🎉 WHAT'S WORKING GREAT

1. ✅ **Timeline Clickable** - All events open slide panel
2. ✅ **Salary Changes** - Show beautiful addendum documents
3. ✅ **Action Buttons** - [+ Comment] and [+ Add Change] work
4. ✅ **Add Change Modal** - Shows 5 beautiful change type options
5. ✅ **Enhanced Cards** - Hours, Bruto, Neto display

---

## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Expected)

### **1. Add Change Modal "Does Nothing After"** ⚠️
**Status:** Expected - Forms not built yet

**What happens:**
- Click [+ Add Change] ✅
- Modal opens with 5 options ✅
- Click an option ✅
- Modal closes ✅
- **No form opens yet** ⚠️

**Why:** We haven't built the individual change forms yet! This was part of the plan.

**Next Steps:**
```
Option Selected → Next Step (Not Built Yet)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Contract Renewal  → Contract renewal form
Salary Change     → Salary change form
Hours Change      → Hours change form
Position Change   → Position change form  
Location Change   → Location change form
```

### **2. Comments - Saving Status** 📝
**You asked:** "comment is not shown (i dont know if it saved for Adéla Jarošová)"

**Status:** Let me check the database...

**Issue:** Comments are console-logged but not saved to database yet.
```typescript
onSave={(comment, date) => {
  console.log('Comment saved:', { comment, date });
  // TODO: Invalidate timeline query to refresh
}}
```

**What's needed:**
- Database table for timeline comments
- API endpoint to save comments
- Query invalidation to refresh timeline

   - Salary Change (most common?)
   - Hours Change
   - Position Change
   - Contract Renewal
   - All of them?

## 🎨 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

```
✅ WORKING PERFECTLY:
  - Timeline with enhanced cards (Bruto/Neto/Hours)
  - Clickable events
  - Salary addendum view
  - Action buttons
  - Add Change modal (selection)

⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING:
  - Contract view (placeholder only)
  - Add Comment (UI works, not saving)
  - Add Change (modal works, no forms yet)

❌ NOT STARTED:
  - Individual change forms
  - Comment persistence
  - Full contract renderer
  - Trede/Schaal display
  - Manual approval workflow
  - Planned changes flagging
```

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Build in this order:**
1. ✅ **DONE:** Enhanced timeline cards
2. ✅ **DONE:** Clickable events + slide panels
3. 🎯 **NEXT:** Salary change form (most common use case)
4. 🎯 **THEN:** Enable comment saving
5. 🎯 **THEN:** Build remaining change forms
6. 🎯 **THEN:** Full contract view
7. 🎯 **THEN:** Trede/Schaal display

**Reasoning:** Focus on the most common workflows first (salary changes), then expand.
