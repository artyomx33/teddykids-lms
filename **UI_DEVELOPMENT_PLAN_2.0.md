## 🛠 **TECHNICAL APPROACH**

### **Data Access Strategy**
```typescript
// Use existing views and tables - NO MODIFICATIONS
const staffData = await supabase
  .from('contracts_enriched')  // Existing materialized view
  .select('*')
  .eq('staff_id', id);

const salaryHistory = await supabase
  .from('cao_salary_history')  // Existing table
  .select('*')
  .eq('staff_id', id)
  .order('valid_from', { ascending: false });
```
