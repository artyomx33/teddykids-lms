## 🔍 **Contract History Extraction Method**

### Key Insights:
1. **Contract Timeline Tracking**: Different start/end dates between employment and contract objects indicate contract renewals/changes
2. **Salary Progression**: Multiple salary start dates show wage increases over time
3. **Employment Type Changes**: Contract type and hours can change within same employment period
4. **Tax Period Tracking**: Tax details track reduction periods separately

### Historical Data Patterns:
- **Employment dates** ≠ **Contract dates** = Contract renewals within employment
- **Salary start dates** track wage increases
- **Different contract periods** show job role/hour changes
- **Tax reduction periods** indicate special tax status changes

### Sample Timeline Reconstruction:
```
Employee: Adéla Jarošová
├── Employment: 2024-09-01 → 2025-11-09
│   ├── Contract 1: 2024-11-20 → 2025-11-09 (30h/week, parttime)
│   ├── Tax Period: 2024-09-01 → (reduction applied)
│   └── Salary Period: 2025-07-01 → (€18.24/hour, €2846/month)
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Strategy**

### 1. **Primary Data Collection**
```javascript
// Fetch all employees with embedded employment data
const response = await fetch(
  'https://connect.employes.nl/v4/b2328cd9-51c4-4f6a-a82c-ad3ed1db05b6/employees?page=1&per_page=100',
  { headers: authHeaders }
);
```

### 2. **Contract History Reconstruction**
- Parse employment objects to extract contract periods
- Map salary progression timeline
- Track contract type changes
- Identify employment gaps and renewals

### 3. **Data Synchronization**
- Match Employes employees with LMS staff by name/email
- Update contract information from employment data
- Sync salary and working hours
- Track employment status changes
