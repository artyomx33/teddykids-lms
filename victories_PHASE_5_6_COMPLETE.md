- 95%+ = Excellent (100 points)
- 80-94% = Good (80 points)
- 60-79% = Fair (60 points)
- <60% = Poor (40 points)

- 90%+ fresh = Excellent (100 points)
- 70-89% fresh = Good (80 points)
- 50-69% fresh = Fair (60 points)
- <50% fresh = Poor (40 points)

**Data Completeness (0-100)**:
- 80%+ = Excellent
- 60-79% = Good
- 40-59% = Fair
- <40% = Poor

---
