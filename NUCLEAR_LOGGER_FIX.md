# 🔴 NUCLEAR LOGGER FIX

## Critical Issue
The logger was causing initialization errors that crashed both:
- The main app
- The DISC assessment widget

Error: `Cannot access 'le' before initialization`

## Previous Failed Attempts
1. ❌ Removed logger imports from supabase/client
2. ❌ Made isDev lazy with `() => import.meta.env.DEV`
3. ❌ Both still crashed!

## Nuclear Solution
**Completely stubbed out the logger** - it does NOTHING now:

```typescript
const noop = () => {};

export const logger = {
  debug: noop,
  dev: noop,
  info: noop,
  warn: noop,
  error: noop,
  // ... all methods are no-ops
};
```

## Why This Works
- No `import.meta.env` access
- No side effects  
- No initialization code
- Just empty functions that do nothing

## Status
✅ **Build succeeds**
✅ **No errors locally**
🚀 **Deploying now...**

## Test After Deploy
Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel, then test:
- Main app: https://app.teddykids.nl
- Widget: https://app.teddykids.nl/widget/disc-assessment

Both should work without any initialization errors!

## Future Consideration
Once everything is stable, we can consider:
1. Removing the logger entirely
2. Using native console methods directly
3. Using a production-ready logging library

But for now, the stubbed logger ensures nothing breaks.
