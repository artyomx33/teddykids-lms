# üè• Development Environment Surgeon - Deployment Guide

## Overview

The **Development Environment Surgeon** is a specialized agent designed to perform surgical optimization of the entire React/TypeScript/Vite development environment for zero-noise, high-performance development. This system eliminates ALL sources of console pollution and creates pristine development workflows.

## üéØ Mission Statement

- Automatically optimizes slow dependency chains
- Eliminates redundant re-renders
- Optimizes bundle splitting strategies
- Tracks memory usage patterns

- Dynamic port management
- Dependency conflict resolution
- Environment drift correction

## üìö Team Standards

### Development Workflow
1. **Start of Day**: `npm run surgeon:health`
2. **Development Session**: `npm run dev:surgical`
3. **Performance Check**: `npm run surgeon:monitor` (separate terminal)
4. **End of Session**: Review console logs for any noise

### Code Quality Standards
- Zero TypeScript errors in committed code
- Zero console warnings in development
- HMR reload times under 2 seconds
- Build times under 10 seconds for incremental changes

### Environment Maintenance
- Weekly: `npm run surgeon:report`
- Monthly: `npm run surgeon:clean && npm run surgeon:deploy`
- After major dependency updates: `npm run surgeon:deploy`
