## ⚠️ Warnings (Pre-Existing)

### Dynamic Import Warnings
```
(!) employesProfile.ts is dynamically imported
(!) employesContracts.ts is dynamically imported
```

**Status**: These warnings existed before the migration.  
**Impact**: None - these are informational only.  
**Action**: Can optimize later if needed.

### Chunk Size Warning
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 1000 kB
```

**Status**: Pre-existing from before migration.  
**Impact**: None - performance is good.  
**Action**: Already has code splitting, can optimize later if needed.
