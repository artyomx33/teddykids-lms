## üõ°Ô∏è Agent Philosophy

> **"Preserve Everything, Organize Better"**

Our refactoring agents follow these principles:

1. ‚úÖ **ZERO Functionality Loss** - Every feature preserved
2. ‚úÖ **Add Safety** - Error boundaries everywhere
3. ‚úÖ **Improve Testability** - Each piece testable
4. ‚úÖ **Maintain Performance** - No degradation
5. ‚úÖ **Enhance Types** - Remove all `any` types

## üìà Future Refactoring Candidates

Based on complexity analysis, these components should be considered next:

1. **useReviews.ts** (971 lines) - Hook refactoring needed
2. **StaffPage.tsx** - If > 300 lines
3. **Timeline components** - If complex

Run Component Refactoring Architect agent on these when ready!
