## 🔄 Next Steps (To Be Done)

### Step 1: Apply Migrations to Database
You have two options:

**Option A: Manual (Recommended for now)**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gjlgaufihseaagzmidhc
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open the file: `RUN_IN_SUPABASE_REVIEWS_MIGRATIONS.sql`
4. Copy entire contents and paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute
6. Check verification queries at the bottom

**Option B: CLI (Has issues with old migrations)**
```bash
# This might fail due to timeline migration errors
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Test in Frontend
Once migrations are applied:

1. **Open the App:**
   - Dev server should be running
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or check console for actual port)
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Navigate to Staff Profile:**
   - Go to Staff/Employees section
   - Click on any employee
   - Click on "Reviews" tab

3. **Test Review Creation:**
   - Click "Create Review" or "Schedule Review"
   - Select a review template (probation, 6-month, yearly, etc.)
   - Fill in review details
   - Verify all fields are working
   - Save the review

4. **Test Review Display:**
   - Check if created reviews appear in the list
   - View review details
   - Test editing a review
   - Check Performance Analytics tab
   - Check Review Calendar

### Step 3: Verify Data Hooks
Test that all React Query hooks are working:
- `useReviews()` - Fetches review list
- `useReview(id)` - Fetches single review
- `useStaffReviewSummary()` - Shows aggregate stats
- `usePerformanceTrends()` - Shows trends over time
- `useReviewCalendar()` - Calendar view
- `useOverdueReviews()` - Overdue reviews
- `useReviewTemplates()` - Template list

## 📊 Database Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything is set up correctly:

```sql
-- Check review templates were created
SELECT COUNT(*) as template_count FROM review_templates;
-- Should return: 6

-- List all review templates
SELECT type, name, scoring_method, is_active 
FROM review_templates 
ORDER BY type;

-- Check new columns exist in staff_reviews
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'staff_reviews' 
  AND column_name IN ('star_rating', 'performance_level', 'summary', 'due_date', 'achievements')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Check new tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('review_schedules');

-- Check new views exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('overdue_reviews', 'review_calendar', 'staff_reviews_needed');
```

## 🎯 Known Issues

### ⚠️ Migration Push Failed
- Old timeline migrations have errors
- Solution: Use manual SQL execution instead of `supabase db push`
- File created: `RUN_IN_SUPABASE_REVIEWS_MIGRATIONS.sql` (ready to use)

### ⚠️ No Existing Review Data
- Database likely has zero reviews currently
- Templates are seeded, but no actual review records exist
- First test will be creating a review from scratch
