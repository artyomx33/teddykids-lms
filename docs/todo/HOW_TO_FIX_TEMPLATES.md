# üîß Fix Review Templates - Missing Questions

## üéØ Problem
When creating a new review, you're not seeing:
- ‚ùå DISC mini-questions (3 rotating questions)
- ‚ùå Self-assessment section (reflect & respond)
- ‚ùå Full performance rating questions

**BUT** when editing an existing review (one added via DB), you DO see all these sections.

## üîç Root Cause
The **templates in the database** don't have the full v1.1 questions yet. The v1.1 seed migration might not have been run, or the UPDATE statements didn't match existing templates.

## ‚úÖ Solution
Run the **`FIX_REVIEW_TEMPLATES_FULL.sql`** script to recreate all templates with full questions.

---

## üìã Steps to Fix

### 1. Check Current Templates (Optional)
```sql
-- Run this first to see what you have now
SELECT 
  name,
  jsonb_array_length(questions) as question_count,
  disc_injection_enabled,
  self_assessment_required
FROM review_templates;
```

Expected: You'll probably see few questions and `false` for DISC/self-assessment flags.

---

### 2. Run the Fix Script

**Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**

Copy and paste the **entire contents** of:
```
FIX_REVIEW_TEMPLATES_FULL.sql
```

Click **"Run"**

---

### 3. Verify It Worked
You should see:
```
‚úÖ Review templates fixed! All 6 templates now have full v1.1 questions.
```

And a table showing:
| name | review_type | question_count | disc_injection | self_assessment |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Custom Review Template | custom | 5 | true | true |
| Exit Review | exit | 8 | false | true |
| First-Month Review | probation | 10 | true | true |
| Performance Improvement Review | performance | 10 | false | true |
| Six Month Review | six_month | 14 | true | true |
| Yearly Review | yearly | 13 | true | true |
