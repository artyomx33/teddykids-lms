# üéØ COMPLETE EMPLOYES.NL DATA EXTRACTION SYSTEM

## Overview

This system performs a comprehensive, systematic extraction of ALL available data from Employes.nl for any employee. It follows a first-principles approach to discover and document every piece of data available.

## üöÄ What This System Does

### Phase 1: Employee Discovery
- Searches Employes.nl by email or staff ID
- Finds the target employee across all company employees
- Validates employee identity and captures Employes ID

### Phase 2: Basic Data Extraction
- Extracts ALL basic employee fields:
  - Identity (name, employee number, status)
  - Personal details (date of birth, nationality, gender)
  - Contact information (email, phone, mobile)
  - Address (street, house number, zipcode, city, country)
  - Employment status (department, location, position, role)

### Phase 3: Nested Employment Data Extraction ‚≠ê KEY INNOVATION
This is where we extract the historical data that was previously missed!

The Employes.nl API embeds employment history within the employee object:
```javascript
employee.employments = [
  {
    id: "employment-123",
    start_date: "2023-01-01",
    end_date: "2024-06-30",
    contract: { /* contract details */ },
    salary: [ /* array of salary records! */ ],
    hours: { /* working hours */ },
    tax: { /* tax details */ }
  },
  // ... more employment periods
]
```

We extract:
- **Complete Employment Timeline:** All periods of employment
- **Salary Progression:** ALL historical salary records from each employment period
- **Contract History:** Complete contract timeline with types, hours, FTE
- **Working Schedule:** Hours per week and FTE changes over time
- **Tax Information:** Tax details for each employment period

### Phase 4: Individual Endpoint Testing
Tests ALL possible individual employee endpoints:
- `/employees/{id}` - Employee details
- `/employees/{id}/employments` - Employment history
- `/employees/{id}/contracts` - Contracts (if separate endpoint exists)
- `/employees/{id}/salary-history` - Salary history (if separate endpoint exists)
- `/employees/{id}/payslips` - Payslips
- `/employees/{id}/hours` - Working hours
- `/employees/{id}/absences` - Absence records

Documents which endpoints work and which return 403 errors.

### Phase 5: Payroll Data Exploration
- Tests payrun endpoints for detailed wage components
- Extracts employer costs and deductions if available
- Documents payroll data availability

### Phase 6: Data Availability Matrix
Creates a comprehensive matrix showing:
- Which data points are available
- Which fields are populated
- Data quality and completeness
- Recommendations for storage and usage

## üéØ Key Discovery: Historic Data Extraction

### The Problem We Solved
Previously, we were only extracting the **current** salary from `employee.salary`, missing all historical data.

### The Solution
Historic data is embedded in `employee.employments[]` array:
- Each employment period has its own salary records
- Each employment period has its own contract details
- This gives us the COMPLETE timeline!

### Example Data Structure
```javascript
employee.employments = [
  {
    start_date: "2023-01-01",
    end_date: "2024-06-30",
    salary: {
      start_date: "2023-01-01",
      month_wage: 2500,
      hour_wage: 15.62,
      hours_per_week: 36
    },
    contract: {
      type: "bepaalde_tijd",
      hours_per_week: 36,
      start_date: "2023-01-01",
      end_date: "2024-06-30"
    }
  },
  {
    start_date: "2024-07-01",
    end_date: null,  // Current
    salary: {
      start_date: "2024-07-01",
      month_wage: 2750,  // Salary increase!
      hour_wage: 17.19,
      hours_per_week: 36
    },
    contract: {
      type: "onbepaalde_tijd",  // Contract type changed!
      hours_per_week: 36,
      indefinite: true
    }
  }
]
```

## üìö Database Integration Plan

Based on extracted data, here's how to store it:

### 1. cao_salary_history Table
```sql
INSERT INTO cao_salary_history (
  staff_id,
  employes_employee_id,
  gross_monthly,
  hourly_wage,
  yearly_wage,
  hours_per_week,
  cao_effective_date,
  valid_from,
  valid_to,
  scale,
  trede,
  data_source
) VALUES (/* extracted from employment.salary */);
```

### 2. staff_employment_history Table
```sql
INSERT INTO staff_employment_history (
  staff_id,
  employes_employee_id,
  change_type,
  effective_date,
  previous_data,
  new_data
) VALUES (/* extracted from employment periods */);
```

### 3. contracts_enriched View
Update to pull from employment contract data instead of mock data.
