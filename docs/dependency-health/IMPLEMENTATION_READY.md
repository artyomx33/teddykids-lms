## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Option 1: Full Implementation (Recommended)
**Time**: 1.5 hours over 4 days

Follow the detailed [ACTION_PLAN.md](./ACTION_PLAN.md):
- **Day 1** (30 min): Fix jsPDF security
- **Day 2** (15 min): Apply 11 safe updates
- **Day 3** (30 min): Fix @vercel/node security
- **Day 4** (15 min): Verify and report

**Expected Result**: Health score A (95/100), 0 high vulnerabilities

### Option 2: Critical Only (Minimum)
**Time**: 45 minutes

Just fix the critical security issues:
```bash
# Day 1: Fix jsPDF (30 min)
npm run deps:fix:security
# Test PDF generation
git commit -m "fix(deps): update jsPDF to 3.0.3 (security)"

# Day 2: Fix @vercel/node (15 min)
npm install @vercel/node@5.4.0
# Test API endpoints
git commit -m "fix(deps): update @vercel/node to 5.4.0 (security)"
```

**Expected Result**: 0 high vulnerabilities, health score B+ (88/100)

### Option 3: Automated (Set and Forget)
**Time**: 50 minutes setup, then automatic

Set up automation first, then let it handle updates:
1. Set up Dependabot (30 min)
2. Set up CI/CD checks (20 min)
3. Review and merge PRs weekly

**Expected Result**: Gradual improvement over time, fully automated

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start Now (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Verify you're on the right branch
git branch --show-current
# Should show: chore/dependency-health-monitoring

# 2. Check current health
npm run deps:health

# 3. Start with critical fix
npm run deps:fix:security
```

### Or Review First (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Read the action plan
cat docs/dependency-health/ACTION_PLAN.md

# 2. Check what will be updated
npm outdated

# 3. Review security issues
npm audit

# 4. Then decide which option to follow
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before You Start
1. ✅ **Backed up data**: Git is clean, on feature branch
2. ✅ **Time available**: ~1.5 hours over 4 days
3. ✅ **Can test**: PDF generation, API endpoints
4. ✅ **Can commit**: Have git access

### During Implementation
1. **Test thoroughly**: Each update requires testing
2. **Commit frequently**: After each successful update
3. **Document issues**: If something breaks, note it
4. **Ask for help**: If stuck, check docs or rollback

### After Implementation
1. **Verify health**: Run `npm run deps:health`
2. **Update docs**: Mark tasks complete in README
3. **Create PR**: Push branch and create PR
4. **Monitor**: Watch for issues in production

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Shows Different Numbers
```bash
# Refresh package data
npm outdated --json > /tmp/check.json
npm audit --json > /tmp/audit.json

# Check what changed
cat /tmp/audit.json | jq '.metadata.vulnerabilities'
cat /tmp/check.json | jq 'length'
```

### If Scripts Don't Run
```bash
# Make sure they're executable
chmod +x scripts/deps-*.sh

# Check if they exist
ls -la scripts/deps-*.sh
```

### If npm Commands Don't Work
```bash
# Verify package.json has the commands
grep "deps:" package.json

# If missing, re-add them
# (See package.json in the repo)
```
