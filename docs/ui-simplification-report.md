# UI Simplification Review

## Component complexity scores
| Component | Before score* | After score* | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NavigationContainer / NavigationItem | 5 | 2 | Reduced from 60+ lines of conditional styling and tooltip logic to a plain list renderer with 5 props. |
| LayoutEnhanced | 5 | 3 | Removed theme-specific branches, animation effects, and nested configs in favour of a single responsive sidebar. |
| Staff overview listing | 4 | 2 | Replaced 8-column table, custom badges, and shadcn checkboxes with a simple `EmployeeCard` grid and native checkboxes. |
| Dashboard widgets | 4 | 2 | Consolidated four widgets into one `DashboardHighlights` component driven by a small data array. |
| ReviewModal form | 4 | 1 | Swapped custom Select/Switch/Badge components for native `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements. |

\*Score from 1 (trivial) to 5 (over-engineered).

## Merge recommendations
- **Navigation**: Use the new `navigationSections` array for both desktop and mobile; drop alternate configs.
- **Dashboard widgets**: Favour a single `DashboardHighlights` data map instead of individual widgets.
- **Staff cards**: The new `EmployeeCard` replaces table rows, badge components, and review chip variants.
- **Forms**: Prefer native controls with light styling; shadcn wrappers are no longer required for modal forms.
- **Layouts**: Keep only `LayoutEnhanced` as the application shell; the legacy `Layout` component is now redundant.

## Simplified component code
- `src/components/navigation/NavigationContainer.tsx` and `NavigationItem.tsx` render plain nav links with optional badges.
- `src/components/staff/EmployeeCard.tsx` provides a reusable card for staff summaries with a native checkbox hook.
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardHighlights.tsx` renders any set of stat cards from a tiny config array.
- `src/components/reviews/ReviewModal.tsx` uses a straightforward HTML form inside the existing dialog shell.

## Props removed from public interfaces
- `NavigationItemProps`: dropped `theme`, `onKeyDown`, `className`, `isFocused`, and `level` (component now needs only `item` + `onNavigate`).
- Navigation config items: removed `badge.variant`, `tooltip`, `description` arrays for responsiveness; keep `label`, `href`, optional `badge` string.
- Layout: no longer expects `navigationConfig` objects with `theme`, `responsive`, or `accessibility` flagsâ€”`navigationSections` is the single source.
- Staff listing: table-specific props (`ReviewChips`, `Badge`, `Checkbox`) eliminated in favour of the `EmployeeCard` API (`selected`, `onSelect`).
