# 🔄 FIXES STATUS AFTER CACHE CLEAR & SERVER RESTART

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Action Taken**: Cleared Vite cache + Restarted dev server  
**Server Status**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:8080  

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED ACTIONS**

1. ✅ **Cleared Vite cache** - `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
2. ✅ **Restarted dev server** - Fresh start with no cache
3. ✅ **Fixed Issue 4 column name** - `start_date` → `employment_start_date`

---

## 📊 **ISSUES STATUS**

### ✅ **Issue 5: Contract Compliance** - CONFIRMED WORKING
**Status**: User confirmed fixed  
**Result**: Employee names display correctly (not IDs)

---

### ❌ **Issue 3: Drag-and-Drop** - STILL NOT WORKING
**Status**: User reports "nope"  
**Problem**: Still highlighting all rows during drag

**Why it might not be working**:
The `pointer-events: none` fix was applied, but there might be a different issue.

**NEXT DEBUG STEP**:
Let me check if the fix was actually applied correctly. The issue might be:
1. The dragOverRow state is not being set correctly
2. The pointer-events style isn't cascading properly
3. There's a timing issue with state updates

**Files to check**:
- `src/components/staff/StaffDocumentsTab.tsx` - Lines 266-321

---

### ✅ **Issue 4: Interns Page** - NOW FIXED!
**Status**: Was showing column error, now fixed  
**Problem**: `column staff_with_lms_data.start_date does not exist`  
**Solution**: Changed `start_date` to `employment_start_date` (correct column name)  
**Result**: Should now show empty state with helpful message

---

### ⏳ **Issue 2: Schedule Review** - NEEDS FRESH TEST
**Status**: User says "nothing changed"  
**Problem**: Might be cached version  
**Solution Applied**: 
- Changed `scheduled_date` → `next_due_date`
- Added `is_active: true`
- Fixed hook typing

**NEEDS**: Fresh test after cache clear and restart

---

### ⏳ **Issue 1: Review Form Cards** - NEEDS FRESH TEST
**Status**: User says "same as above"  
**Problem**: Was cached  
**Solution**: Cache cleared, server restarted  
**Expected**: Should now show colored cards with emojis

---

   - "No staff members are currently marked as interns"
   - "To add interns, update staff records in the Staff section"

---

## 🐛 **ISSUE 3 DEBUG PLAN**

Since drag-drop still isn't working, let's investigate:

### **Possible Causes**:
1. **State timing**: dragOverRow might be null when style is evaluated
2. **Event propagation**: Children might still be receiving events
3. **CSS specificity**: Another style might be overriding pointer-events

### **Debug Steps**:
1. Check browser console for any errors during drag
2. Use React DevTools to inspect dragOverRow state during drag
3. Check if pointer-events style is actually applied in browser inspector
4. Verify onDragOver is being called on correct elements

### **Alternative Fix** (if current approach doesn't work):
Instead of pointer-events, we could:
1. Use `e.stopPropagation()` in TableCell onDragOver handlers
2. Add data-draggable attribute to TableRow only
3. Check `e.currentTarget` vs `e.target` in onDragOver

---

## 📝 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test Issues 1, 2, 4** - These should all work now after cache clear
2. **Debug Issue 3** - Need to investigate why drag-drop still failing
3. **Report results** - Let me know what works and what doesn't

---

## 🚨 **IF ISSUES 1 & 2 STILL DON'T WORK**

If after cache clear and restart, Issues 1 and 2 still don't work, try:

1. **Hard refresh browser**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Clear browser cache**: Browser settings → Clear cache
3. **Check browser console**: Look for any errors
4. **Verify files changed**: Run `git diff` to confirm changes are in code

**Server is running, cache is cleared - ready for testing!** 🚀
