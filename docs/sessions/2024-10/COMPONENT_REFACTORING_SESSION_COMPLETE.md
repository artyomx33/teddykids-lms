## 🚀 Implementation Phases Defined

### 7-Phase Safe Migration Strategy

**Phase A: Preparation** (30 min, Zero risk)
- Create directory structure
- Set up error boundaries
- Create types file

**Phase B: Business Logic** (2 hrs, Low risk)
- Extract calculations
- Extract transformations
- Extract validation rules
- Write tests

**Phase C: Custom Hooks** (3 hrs, Medium risk)
- Extract state management
- Extract validation
- Extract submission logic
- Test in isolation

**Phase D: Context Setup** (1 hr, Low risk)
- Create ReviewFormContext
- Wrap existing component
- Verify no breaks

**Phase E: Component Extraction** (4 hrs, Medium risk)
- Extract reusable components
- Extract section components
- Test after each extraction

**Phase F: Final Assembly** (2 hrs, High risk but tested)
- Create new structure
- Wire everything together
- Add error boundaries
- Deploy

**Phase G: Cleanup** (1 hr, Low risk)
- Remove backup
- Update imports
- Final verification

**Total: ~13 hours**

---

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Zero Functionality Loss Guarantee
Every feature documented and preserved:
- All props, state, handlers mapped
- All business logic extracted intact
- All edge cases preserved
- All validations maintained

### 2. 4-Layer Error Boundary Protection
```
Layer 1: Top-level (ReviewFormErrorBoundary)
  └─ Layer 2: Provider (ReviewFormContext)
      └─ Layer 3: Sections (SectionErrorBoundary)
          └─ Layer 4: Components (specific boundaries)
```

**Result**: One section crashes → Others keep working!

### 3. Complete Type Safety
- Remove all `any` types
- Create proper interfaces for everything
- Database schema types
- Form data types
- Validation error types

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for business logic (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for flows
- Manual test checklist (25+ items)
- Performance benchmarks
