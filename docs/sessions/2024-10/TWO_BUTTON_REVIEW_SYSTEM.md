# ✅ Two-Button Review System - Complete!

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Feature:** Separated "Schedule Review" vs "Complete Review" workflows  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Single "Schedule New Review" button was confusing
- Users didn't know if they were planning a future review or completing one now
- Same form for both planning and execution
- No distinction between scheduling and completing

**After:** Two separate buttons with clear purposes
- **"Schedule for Later"** - Plan a future review (simple form)
- **"Complete Review Now"** - Do the full review immediately (v1.1 form)

---

## 🗂️ Database Structure

### Planned Reviews → `review_schedules` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE review_schedules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  staff_id UUID NOT NULL,
  template_id UUID NOT NULL,
  scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT (pending/completed/cancelled),
  notes TEXT,
  created_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Purpose:** Store future review plans and reminders

### Completed Reviews → `staff_reviews` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE staff_reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  staff_id UUID NOT NULL,
  template_id UUID NOT NULL,
  review_date DATE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT,
  star_rating INTEGER,
  overall_score NUMERIC,
  responses JSONB,
  self_assessment JSONB,
  disc_snapshot JSONB,
  disc_questions_answered JSONB,
  xp_earned INTEGER,
  goals_previous JSONB,
  goals_next JSONB,
  -- ... 40+ v1.1 fields
);
```

**Purpose:** Store actual completed review data with all v1.1 enhancements
