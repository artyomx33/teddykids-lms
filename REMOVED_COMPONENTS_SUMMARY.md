## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Keep It Simple (Current State)
**Pros:**
- Clean, single source of truth
- All data from `employes_changes`
- No redundancy

**Cons:**
- Missing critical alerts (EmploymentStatusBar)
- Missing detailed salary charts

### Option B: Recreate Missing Components
**What to rebuild:**

1. **EmploymentStatusBar** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Shows critical alerts
   - Contract ending warnings
   - Chain rule violations
   - **Data source:** `employes_changes` + contract metadata

2. **SalaryProgressionAnalytics** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Detailed salary timeline chart
   - Visual representation of raises
   - **Data source:** `employes_changes` (filter by `change_type='salary_change'`)

3. **Skip ContractTimelineVisualization** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Redundant - data already in `EmploymentOverviewEnhanced`
