# ✅ Widget White Screen Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Solved
The DISC assessment widget was crashing with:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'le' before initialization
```

## Root Cause
The `logger.ts` module had **side effects at module load time**:
- It immediately evaluated `import.meta.env.DEV` when imported
- This caused initialization order issues in the production bundle
- The minified variable `le` (logger) was accessed before initialization

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed ALL Logger Dependencies from Widget Path
- Cleaned up `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` completely
- Removed both imports AND comments about logger

### 2. Made Logger Side-Effect Free
Changed logger from:
```typescript
const isDev = import.meta.env.DEV; // Runs at module load!
```

To lazy evaluation:
```typescript
const isDev = () => import.meta.env.DEV; // Only runs when called
```

Updated all references to call `isDev()` as a function.

## Result
✅ **Widget loads without errors**
- Build succeeds: `index-CN-HNaz6.js` 
- Local test: No errors
- Pushed to production: Commit `93ca06e`

## Deployment Status
- **Commit**: `93ca06e`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Deployed to Vercel

Wait ~2 minutes for Vercel to deploy, then test:

## Key Learning
**Never have side effects in module initialization!** Even simple variable assignments can cause initialization order issues in production bundles.

The logger was just a development helper but was causing production crashes. By making it side-effect free, we ensure it can be safely imported anywhere without breaking the app.
