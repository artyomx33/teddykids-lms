## ðŸ”§ What Happened

### The Problem
When trying to create a PR, GitHub detected conflicts between `migration/vite-7` and `main` because:
- Main had moved forward (new commits were merged)
- Our branch was based on an older version of main
- `package-lock.json` had conflicting changes

### The Solution
1. âœ… Committed Phase 3 documentation
2. âœ… Fetched latest from origin
3. âœ… Rebased on latest main
4. âœ… Resolved package-lock.json conflict (regenerated)
5. âœ… Force pushed updated branch

## ðŸ’¡ What We Learned

### Conflict Resolution
1. When main moves forward, rebase to stay current
2. `package-lock.json` conflicts â†’ regenerate with `npm install`
3. Force push after rebase (history was rewritten)
4. Always verify build after conflict resolution

### Best Practices
1. Keep branches up to date with main
2. Rebase regularly during development
3. Test after resolving conflicts
4. Document the resolution process
